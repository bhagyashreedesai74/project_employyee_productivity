## Objective
To analyze employee attendance, performance, and project handling efficiency across departments, and identify patterns or outliers that affect productivity.

## Key Insights
1. Attendance Rate
The overall attendance rate is 52%, indicating frequent absenteeism.

HR and IT departments show higher weekday absences, especially on Mondays and Fridays — possibly pointing to burnout or poor scheduling.

2. Average Work Hours
The average work hours per week is around 46.95 hours.

Most departments stay close to this mark, suggesting consistent workload across the board.

3. Performance Score
The average performance score is 2.99 on a scale of 1 to 5.

The top score observed is 5, achieved by a few standout employees.

4. Project Analysis
Example: Employee E1000 from Finance has handled 12 projects but has a low performance score of 2, indicating:

5. Sick Days vs. Tenure
There's no strong correlation between years at company and sick days — but some departments (e.g., Sales, Marketing) show irregular patterns that need further attention.

6. Department Performance
On average:

HR and Operations departments show higher performance scores.

IT lags slightly below the average.

7. Absenteeism Patterns
Weekends (Saturday/Sunday) show expected dips, but Tuesday and Friday show notable absences across most departments.

## Recommendations
Introduce performance improvement plans for employees with low scores despite high project loads.

Monitor departments with high absenteeism — especially early/late weekdays.

Consider incentives or flexible schedules for frequent absentees.

Use this dashboard for quarterly HR reviews, one-on-one discussions, and departmental benchmarking.
